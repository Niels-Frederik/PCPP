## Chapter 1
### Section 1.1
** Processes ** : Isolated, independently executing pro-
grams to which the operating system allocates resources such as memory, ﬁle
handles, and security credentials.

processes could communicate with one another through a variety of coarse-grained communication mechanisms: sockets, signal handlers, shared memory, semaphores, and ﬁles.

Motivation for executing programs simultaneously:
- Resource utilization (sometimes programs have to wait for resources, and this wait time can be efficient to let another program run meanwhile)
- Fairness (Programs may have equal claims to the machines resources, so it is preferable to let them share, rather than letting one program run to completion)
- Convenience (Easier to write multiple programs that perform a single task, and let them communicate, rather than one program performing all the tasks)
